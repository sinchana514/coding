QUESTION
Write a Java Program to separate the Individual Characters from a String

Description:
In computer science, collection of characters including spaces is called as string. To separate an individual character from the string, individual characters are accessed through its index.

Algorithm
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: DEFINE String string = "characters "
STEP 3: PRINT "Individual characters from given string: "
STEP 4: SET i=0. REPEAT STEP 5 to STEP 6 UNTIL i<string.length()
STEP 5: PRINT string.charAt(i)
STEP 6: i=i+1
STEP 7: END

CODE
public class IndividualCharacters  
{  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        String string = "characters";  
          
        //Displays individual characters from given string  
        System.out.println("Individual characters from given string:");  
          
        //Iterate through the string and display individual character  
        for(int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++){  
            System.out.print(string.charAt(i) + "  ");  
        }  
    }  
}
