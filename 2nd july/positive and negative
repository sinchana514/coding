QUESTION
Write a program that will read a sequence of positive real numbers entered by the user and will print the same numbers in sorted order from smallest to largest. The user
will input a zero to mark the end of the input. Assume that at most 100 positive numbers will be entered.

CODE
package rr;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int number;
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the number you want to check:");
        number = scan.nextInt();
        scan.close();
        if(number > 0)
        {
            System.out.println(number+" is positive number");
        }
        else if(number < 0)
        {
            System.out.println(number+" is negative number");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println(number+" is neither positive nor negative");
        }
    }

}
